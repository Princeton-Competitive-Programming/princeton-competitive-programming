{% include main_title.html text="ICPC and Competing in Contests" %}

The International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) is the oldest,
largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the
world. Competing in ICPC contests involves teams of three students
solving complex algorithmic problems within a strict time limit. It's
an intense, fast-paced challenge that demands sharp coding and
problem-solving skills. Success relies on teamwork, as participants
must collaborate effectively under pressure.

Interested students will follow a sequence of contests in the ICPC
which culminate in the ICPC World Finals. Here's a general outline of
the progression:

* **Local Qualifier**: The journey begins with a local selection
    contest which will be held in Princeton in the **first week of
    October** (more details to be announced soon). You will be able to
    participate as a team or individually in this contest and 5 teams
    will be selected to represent Princeton at the next stage.

* **Greater New York Regional Contest**: The selected teams then
    advance to the regional contest. This will be held on **Sunday,
    October 29** at Columbia University. Here is the [contest
    website](http://acmgnyr.org/year2022/) from last year. The top ~5
    teams (this varies slightly every year) will qualify for the next
    stage, but only one per university (so if teams from Princeton
    place first and second overall, only the first team will advance).

* **North American Championship**: If successful at the regional
    level, a team will qualify for the North American Championship,
    which will happen at some point at the **end of the Spring
    semester**. This event brings together top teams from across North
    America for a highly competitive contest, where the first ~18
    teams (this varies slightly every year) will qualify for the next
    stage. Here is the [contest website](https://nac.icpc.global/).

* **ICPC World Finals**: The World Finals is the pinnacle of ICPC
    competitions, featuring elite teams from around the world. It's a
    global gathering of top student programmers. The date for next
    year's world finals is yet to be announced. Here is the [contest
    website](https://worldfinals.icpc.global) (which currently
    contains information about the 2023 edition, for which teams
    qualified this past year).
