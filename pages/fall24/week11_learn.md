Welcome to the last week of competitive programming of the Fall of
2024! Today's problem solving session doesn't have a topic. You will
be presented with miscellaneous so you can practice your problem
solving skills!

Before reading a problem, read its accompanying description available
below. Work through the problems one by one, i.e. don't try working on
B before solving A, C before solving A, etc.

But first, if this is your first time ever in one of our
competitive programming sessions, please follow the instruction on our
new [introduction guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/intro_guide) to get
started. Once you're done, feel free to come back here.
