Welcome to the first week of competitive programming of the Fall of
2024! Today's problem solving session will be a sort of warm up
session, with problems designed to help you get used to the format of
the event.

But first of all, if this is your first time ever in one of our
competitive programming sessions, please follow the instruction on our
new [introduction guide]({{ site.baseurl }}/intro_guide) to get
started.

## Problem 1 - Target Practice

This is an implementation problem, you don't have to do anything too
clever. Just follow the instructions on the problem statement.

## Problem 2 - Princeton Cards

Note that $N$ can be pretty large ($10^6$). So you'll need a
$\Theta(N)$ or $\Theta(N \log N)$ solution to solve this problem, and
(if you are using Java) fast input.

A hint: sorting is your friend. If you don't know how to sort in Java,
use [this
method](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Arrays.html#sort-int:A-).

## Problem 3 - Biggest Island

In this problem you might need to use a data structure to help
you. You need something that lets you assign elements to groups, and
then count the number of groups.
