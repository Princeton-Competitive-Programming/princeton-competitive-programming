	Are you preparing for a technical interview, grinding LeetCode
	problems for the next recruiting season, or looking for a way
	to brush up on your coding skills?
      </p>

      <p>
	We'll have a curated set of LeetCode problems and experienced
	student mentors from Princeton ACM to help walk you through
	them or discuss solutions one-on-one, along with <strong>pizza</strong>!
      </p>

      <p>
	All coding experience levels are welcome, and you can also
	just come to discuss tech recruiting or other coding problems
	with our mentors. We hope to see you there!
