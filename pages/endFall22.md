### Week 12 (December 9)

After 12 weeks of competitive programming we are finally at the end of
the semester. To celebrate this occasion, we will have an end of
semester special contest with prizes and some holiday cheer. The
contest is open to all undergraduate students at Princeton, and will
have two brackets/divisions, one for students that have little to no
experience in competitive programming, and one for students that are
more comfortable with competitive programming. There will be prizes
for both divisions, so everyone has a chance of winning!

Bring **a charged laptop** and optionally pen and paper to work on
problems. To participate all you need is an account on codeforces
([create one here](https://codeforces.com)) and then to join our
codeforces group (if you haven't done so already, click on "Join" [on
this page](https://codeforces.com/group/hNnRWqFua0/contests)). Just
before the contest starts on Friday we will provide the links to the
submission pages.

The contest starts this **Friday** December 9 at **5:10pm** and lasts
two hours, so it finishes at **7:10pm**, and it will take place in
**Fine Hall 214**. Try to show up at 5pm so you can have time to
setup.

We want to have free pizza and snacks for everyone, just like we do
every week. We need to have an approximate headcount to estimate
how much food we need, so if you could [register
here](https://forms.gle/U13UQextVdcAyotE8) (takes less than 1 minute)
it would be very helpful! If you forget to register you can still
come, this is just so we have an estimate of people.

## Contest Rules

The contest is divided into two divisions: division I; and division
II.

 * **Division II** is intended for those with little or no
   competitive programming experience.

 * **Division I** is intended for those with experience in
     competitive programming.

You should pick whichever one suits you better and you are not allowed
to participate on both divisions, so pick one and stick to it. The two
divisions will contain different problems and prizes for the top
participants in each division.

Note that most contest problems will have appeared before in other
competitions from around the world, we won't have original problems in
our contests unless otherwise mentioned. You shouldn't try to search
for the original problem, since this would be cheating.

The contest links will be placed here just before the competition
starts.

## Prizes

The top 2 students in division I will get prizes as well as the top
student in division II. We also award an extra fun secret prize to a
participant in either division I or II to be revealed at the end.

The list of prizes includes:

 * 3 books on competitive programming
 * 1 book on mathematical puzzles
 * Several Rubik's cube variations
 * One gyroscope math/physics toy
 * Super secret fun prize

We'll also have the usual free food and snacks for everyone.
