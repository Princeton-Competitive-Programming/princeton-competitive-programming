{% include main_title.html text="ICPC Team Local Qualifier 2023" %}

If you are interested in competing in the ICPC contests in 2023, the
local qualifier will happen this **Friday October 6 at 5:15pm**
and it will take place in **Friend Center 006**. This will consist of
a 2.5-hour teamed contest (so it finishes at 7:45pm) which will be
held on CodeForces. Try to show up at 5pm so you can have time to
setup, since the contest will start at 5:15pm sharp.

To sign up to compete please see the notice on the announcements
channel on discord or contact [Pedro
Paredes](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~pparedes/)
(pparedes_at_cs.princeton.edu).

## Contest Information

We will be selecting the top 5 teams to represent Princeton in the
Greater NY Regional Contest, which will take place Sunday, October 29
at Columbia University (more info here:
[http://acmgnyr.org/year2023/](http://acmgnyr.org/year2023/)). Do not
sign up to participate in the local qualifier unless you are planning
on attending the regional contest at Columbia.

## Contest Rules

Please read these carefully.

* You need to be registered in order to be eligible to advance to the
  ICPC regional. To do so, please see the notice on the announcements
  channel on discord or contact [Pedro
  Paredes](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~pparedes/)
  (pparedes_at_cs.princeton.edu).

* The contest will take exactly 2 hours and a half. In the event of a
  prolonged codeforces outage (which is rare, but unfortunately happens),
  an extension might be granted to everyone. No extensions will be
  granted in case of lateness (so try to be on time).

* Each team will only be allowed to use one laptop during the contest,
  so you'll have to share one laptop. This includes all interactions
  with a computer, including looking at problem statements. We will be
  providing paper copies of the problem statements to all team
  members.

* You are allowed to use any code you have stored locally, which
  includes solutions you wrote up to previous problem, implementations
  of data structures or algorithms, or any code templates. However,
  you are not allowed to search the internet for anything. You are
  also not allowed to use chatGPT or GitHub Copilot (or any LLM tool,
  running locally or on the internet) to generate any type of code.

* There will be 7 problems of ranging difficulties, which can be in
  any order of difficulty (so problem A might **not** be the
  easiest). These are not original problems, they are taken from other
  public contests available online, so you are not allowed to try to
  find any information about the original contest.

* Unlike the usual weekly competitive programming sessions, you should
  not ask other people for help, nor will you be allowed to look at
  test cases you are failing. You will be 100% on your own. Obviously
  this excludes your teammates, you are encouraged to discuss ideas
  with teammates. Please do report any issues you find, though.

* The standings will be determined as follows: first number of
  problems solved (more is better), tie breaking by the sum of the
  number of minutes taken to solve each problem plus 20 extra minutes
  per incorrect submission to an accepted problem (less is better),
  which is the default CodeForces ranking method.

* You will be able to see the scoreboard through out the contest,
  except for the last hour. During this last hour the scoreboard will
  be shown as "frozen" and it won't be updated. Obviously your
  submissions will still count, but you won't be able to see them on
  the scoreboard. The ranking will be revealed shortly after the time
  is up.

## Contest Instructions

Please follow these carefully.

* The contest will be on the [Princeton ICPC
  Group](https://codeforces.com/group/hNnRWqFua0/contests) as
  "Princeton ICPC Selection Contest 2023-24", and it will show up
  there around an hour before the competition starts.
  
* To participate in the contest you will need to register as a team on
  codeforces. To do so, you should create a team ahead of time, which
  you can do here:
  [https://codeforces.com/teams](https://codeforces.com/teams). Add
  all of your teammates to your team and register as that team for the
  contest once it is up on the [Princeton ICPC
  Group](https://codeforces.com/group/hNnRWqFua0/contests).

* Looking at the problems and submitting solutions will work exactly
  like the usual weekly problem solving sessions.

If you have any questions ask [Pedro
Paredes](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~pparedes/)
(pparedes_at_cs.princeton.edu) for help.
