{% include main_title.html text="ICPC Team Local Qualifier 2023" %}

If you are interested in competing in the ICPC contests in 2023, the
local qualifier will happen this **Friday October 6 at 5:15pm**
and it will take place in **Friend Center 006**. This will consist of
a 2.5-hour teamed contest (so it finishes at 7:45pm) which will be
held on CodeForces. Try to show up at 5pm so you can have time to
setup.

To sign up to compete please see the notice on the announcements
channel on discord or contact [Pedro
Paredes](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~pparedes/)
(pparedes_at_cs.princeton.edu).

## Contest Information

Each team can have up to 3 members and each team will only be allowed
to use one laptop during the contest (so you'll have to share one
laptop).

We will be selecting the top 5 teams to represent Princeton in the
Greater NY Regional Contest, which will take place Sunday, October 29
at Columbia University (more info here:
[http://acmgnyr.org/year2023/](http://acmgnyr.org/year2023/)). Do not
sign up to participate in the local qualifier unless you are planning
on attending the regional contest at Columbia.

The standings will be determined as follows: first number of problems
solved (more is better), tie breaking by the sum of the number of
minutes taken to solve each problem plus 20 extra minutes per
incorrect submission (less is better), which is the default CodeForces
ranking method.


## Contest Rules

The rules will be here soon.
