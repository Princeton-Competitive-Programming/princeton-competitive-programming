### Week 7 (October 28)

Halloween is next week, so to celebrate it we are having a special <span class="badge text-bg-warning"><i class="bi bi-bug-fill"></i>Spoooky Constest<i class="bi bi-bug-fill"></i></span>. This is open to everyone (including new comers!). To make things interesting we will have some prizes for the top 3. To make things even more interesting we will have an handicap to level the playing field, meaning that even beginners will have a chance to win.

## Contest Rules

The contest is an *upsolving* contest. [Upsolving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/upsolve) means solving problems after the end of a contest, which is essential to improve at competitive programming (and indeed, to improve at problem solving in general).

So the rules are simple:

 * You can solve any problem from any of the past division I contests we have had (listed bellow), as long as you haven't solved it before.
 * You can get credit for a problem if you haven't solved it before 5pm and you submit an Accepted solution to Codeforces before 7:30pm.
 * Problems A/B/C are worth 1 point and D/E are worth 2 points each.

Here are the list of past contests (tip: try to solve more recent problems first):

 * [Week 6 contest](https://codeforces.com/group/hNnRWqFua0/contest/403533)
 * [Week 5 contest](https://codeforces.com/group/hNnRWqFua0/contest/402608)
 * [Week 4 contest](https://codeforces.com/group/hNnRWqFua0/contest/400171)
 * [Week 2 contest](https://codeforces.com/group/hNnRWqFua0/contest/399159)
 * [Week 1 contest](https://codeforces.com/group/hNnRWqFua0/contest/398008)

## Prizes

We have prizes for the 3 students with the most points. In the event of ties the tiebreaker is the number of problems solved before the contest (so all problems from the Princeton ICPC Group solved in the past). Here is the list of prizes:

 * 1st Place - Book *Mathematical Puzzles: A Connoisseur's Collection* by Peter Winkler
 * 2nd Place - 3 Rubik's cube variations
 * 3rd Place - 1 Rubik's cube variation

We'll also have the usual free food and extra Halloween candy.

## Winners

 * 1st Place - Daniel Yang '26
 * 2nd Place - Raheem Idowu '25
