{% include main_title.html text="Spring 24 Sessions" %}

In the Spring of 2024 we are hosting a problem solving session every
Friday from 5pm to 7:30pm (more information about this below). This is
open to everyone interested in competitive programming, regardless of
how experienced you are. There is also no commitment, so feel free to
show up at any of the sessions. We will have **free food and snacks**
during each session.

If you want to know more information about competitive programming
check our [about page]({{ site.baseurl }}/about). We also have a
[resources page]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources) with lots of links to
materials of all levels for you to practice and learn more. Finally,
if you are thinking about competing in the International Collegiate
Programming Contests, check our [contests
page]({{ site.baseurl }}/icpc).

We have a <i class="bi bi-discord"></i> Discord channel, to join please
contact [Pedro Paredes](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~pparedes/)
(pparedes_at_cs.princeton.edu).

## Basic Information

We have regular sessions every **Friday** from **5pm to 7:30pm** in
**Friend Center Room 006** (we will be on a different room a couple
times this semester, check the schedule below). You will need a laptop
and optionally pen and paper to work on problems. Also, you don't have
to be there for the full two and a half hours, if you can only show up
for an hour, please feel free to do so!

Each week will start with a 2 hour problem solving session followed by
a 30 minute discussion of the problem solutions.

Each session is divided into two groups: the division I group; and the
division II group. You are free to choose whatever group you want and
you can switch at any point.

 * **The division II** group is intended for those with little or no
   competitive programming experience. The problems will often have
   associated readings for you to learn new concepts.

 * **The division I** is intended for those with experience in
     competitive programming. Each session will contain problems of
     varying difficulties to target different levels of experience.

Note that most problems have appeared before in other
competitions from around the world.

Our sessions are going to be hosted on a platform called
[codeforces](https://codeforces.com/). You will need an account in
order to solve problems here. We also have a group you can join by
going to the following link:

(you should click on *join* on the right in order to access the
problems).
